# A Cube and A Sphere

### One disclaimer must be add : I did not implement a soft body simulation and raytracing in this project, because it would take a lot of time and I needed a working demo, so for now enviromental mappin serves as a raytracer and unfortunatelly the shpere does not deform(but I believe it will, however, a bit later)
## Features

- Fluid Simulation running on GPU
- Enviromental Mapping 
- Texure Mapping for a sphere
- Sick looking Cube

### To make long story short I just have played with DirectX 11 for a while and have used a couple of interesting and peculiar technicues ;), if someone thinks that he can use it in the future you are welcome, but I will not lie it is the most spagetti-code I have ever seen I my life
